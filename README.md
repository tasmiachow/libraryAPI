# libraryAPI
This project implements a simple Library Management System using an array-based bag structure. The system allows users to check in, check out, display, and manage books within a library. It also maintains the history of books that have been checked out. The project consists of three main components:

Book Class – Represents individual books.
ArrayBag Class – Implements a generic bag (collection) of items.
LibraryRecord Class – Inherits from ArrayBag and adds library-specific functionality such as checking books in and out, tracking check-out history, and managing the inventory of books.
